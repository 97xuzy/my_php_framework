my_php_framework
=============

<p>A MVC php framework</p>
<p>The mechanism of this framework is similar to Codeigniter, since that is the first framework I used</p>
<p>The routing part of the framework is derived from code from a blog post (http://www.cnblogs.com/fredshare/archive/2012/09/17/2688944.html)</p>
